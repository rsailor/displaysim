displaysim
==========

### The Summary
Buffered display simulation in Processing intended for conversion to AVR C.

### More Details
I needed to create a low level graphics library for a buffered screen. I used
Processing to simulate a screen with an additional buffer and wrote a set of
basic graphics functions using common algorithms. The code was written in such
a way that it may be easy to convert to embedded C for an AVR microcontroller.
